snippet:    A picture is worth 1000 words. The average .gif is about 100 frames so that's like... 100,000 words right?

"A picture is worth 1000 words. The average .gif is about 100 frames so that's like... 10,000 words right?"

The animated '.gif' is just one example of how people can communicate on the internet with more than just words. Gifs have made me laugh, they've made me cry, and somehow they've made me feel connected to this llama in in a surprisingly spiritual way. The most important thing the .gif has done is that it's made me feel connected with the person on the other side of my screen. These vignettes give one a window into the internet's real feelings better than their words ever could. I propose that the animated .gif is improving our our ability to communicate online for the following reasons:

*1: Language is for communication.*

People can argue about semantics and syntax till the cows come home but in the end all that matters is the transfer of ideas. It may not be elegant but as long as the message gets from person A to person B, language has done its job. Anything which can improve and optimize this process does so for language as a whole. If somebody is able to communicate more effectively with a picture than with their words they should not be criticized; they're just using the tools at their disposal (the entire internet) to its full potential.

*2. Language is evolving.*

If you've read Shakespeare you can tell where I'm going with this. Language is constantly being edited, added to, modified, and abridged. English isn't a static set of rules and vocabulary created hundreds of years ago, it is fluid and changing every day and thanks to the internet it's changing faster than ever. It may be hard to accept for a die-hard fan of the written word, but things change. Right now the way we communicate is moving towards using not only words but pictures, videos, sounds, and memes all at the same time. It's actually pretty cool if you don't fight it. 

*3. People are bad at writing on the internet.*

There are a lot of great writers. There are even a lot of great writers on the internet. Unfortunately the vast majority of the written content on the internet is terrible and unless we are willing to hire personal editors for our YouTube comments, this isn't going to change any time soon. We read badly written content, so we create badly written content-- it's an English teacher's worst nightmare. 

*4. The internet isn't going away.*

 The internet is constantly growing and if anything it's going to continue to grow until everybody who wants to be on the internet is. The internet isn't going anywhere and neither are the ways we communicate on it. There will always be IRC, mailing lists, message boards, and of course comments with .gifs.

With these ideas we can summarize that the internet is a huge place with lots of people who don't know how to write, but they don't really care because they're just trying to communicate with one another. The problem with this picture being that we aren't able to adequately communicate because we suck at writing.

Enter: the .gif.

 The animated .gif is able to augment written content and sometimes replace it all together. It allows us to be bad writers but not let that get in the way of the ideas we're trying to share. It does what most people aren't able to do with their own writing: show, not tell. Not just in the literal sense that it is a picture that you are showing to others, but it describes with greater detail and accuracy what we are trying to say than most are capable of, or willing to, write.

The .gif gives many a way to express their feelings with pinpoint accuracy to countless anonymous individuals. It gives one the ability to be concise, to the point, and true to their intended message while also standing out in a sea of text. In a way, the .gif give those a voice who don't have one... or at least those who aren't very good at utilizing the one they already have.

So next time you're convinced kids these days are ruining English with their cat gifs, just remember...

*To prove my point, here's a little story told with the aid of .gifs:*

This last term I took a really difficult class called 'Discrete Mathematics'. It mostly deals with concepts like sets of numbers, graphs, and counting. As simple as that sounds I spent most of my class really...

... confused.

I sat next to a friend who is really full of himself. He was always able to work into a conversation how easy and intuitive discrete was.

We took our second midterm a few weeks ago and despite his alleged intuitive understanding he immediately started having a breakdown.

Half way through he gave up and turned in his unfinished test with regret in his eyes.

Later I found him and asked what happened. He said he just didn't get it and it was a total bs class. I recalled when he told me how 'intuitive' and 'easy' it was earlier...

... but I didn't say anything.

In the end I got an A and he bombed the class.
