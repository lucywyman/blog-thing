[Chrome is a very popular web browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_web_browsers#Summary_table). This is a fact. You may not use Chrome, you may have strong feelings about not using Chrome, and you may have strong feelings about people who do Chrome-- that's fine.

Because it is such a popular web-browser, this week's project is an extension for Chrome which reads my RSS feed and displays the recent posts I've made to Project52. If you don't want to subscribe to these through a fancy RSS reader, but you DO want to add a cool orange button to your Chrome window that does what I've just described, take a look at the [GitHubPage to find out how to install the extension](https://github.com/ElijahCaine/p52_chrome_extensiohttps://github.com/ElijahCaine/p52_chrome_extensionn). I promise it is very easy. If you aren't a fan of Chrome, I'm planning to port this concent to Firefox so you may be in luck.

The extension is very simple. It reads from my RSS feed (which usually only stores the three most recent posts I've made) and displays in a window the posts it found. The user is given the title of each post and a short introduction. It isn't a killer app, but it isn't supposed to be. The extension has one job and it delivers exactly as advertised; nothing more and nothing less. It has the potential for more functionality in the future (unread counter, deleting posts you've already read, etc) if I get industrious at some point, but it's not broken and that's all I can really ask for from my first shot at this.

Here's a picture:

{Obligatory Thanks} This couldn't have gotten done without the couple dozen posts I found on Stack Overflow, the [jquery-rss project](https://github.com/sdepold/jquery-rss), and [Google's Chrome-Extension tutorials](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted). Thank you Internet.
