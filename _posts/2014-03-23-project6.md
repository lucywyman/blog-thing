As society grows more and more dependent on 9-5 desk jobs we tend to focus less and less on staying active and healthy in our every day lives. It is suggested that individuals get up and move around about every [15 minutes](http://lifehacker.com/5840754/forget-the-standing-desk-you-just-need-to-move-regularly). That doesn't sound difficult... until you actually try to think ways to get your keester out your seat every quarter hour-- it's actually hard!

I don't have a solution for everybody (I'm working on it), but if you're an avid coder, use [GNU/Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Linux), and enjoy the [tile-based window manager 'i3'](http://i3wm.org/), then you'll enjoy my snazzy new status bar module ['Py3HealthBar'](https://github.com/ElijahCaine/py3HealthBar). 

It's a simple tool written in Python with the help of [Py3Status](https://github.com/ultrabug/py3status) that shows you a little green '#' for every 5 minutes you're sitting down. Once it hits 15 minutes the '#' marks turn red; after an hour passes it turns on your lock screen.

The purpose of Py3HealthBar isn't to force you to become a health nut by running a marathon every 15 minutes; it is intended to be a slight nudge, encouraging you to be a little active a few times an hour. You can ignore the marks on your screen, modify them so they increment at a slower rate, and immediately log back in when your machine locks; but the intended purpose is to encourage you, not force you, to do something every so often. By cheating the HealthBar, you're cheating yourself.

This project was a unique experience full of a lot of 'firsts': 

* First time collaborating on a GitHub with a peer ([Lucy Wyman](https://github.com/lucywyman))
* First time writing a [README](https://github.com/ElijahCaine/py3HealthBar/blob/master/README.md)
* First time creating a tool intended beyond personal use
* First time contacting a developer to ask a question on [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irc) ([Ultrabug](https://github.com/ultrabug)

As always this project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ElijahCaine/py3HealthBar). Don't forget to click around to learn anything you don't already. Thank you for reading!
