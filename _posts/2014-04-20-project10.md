Encryption is pretty cool... I just have to get that out of the way. 

I recently finished listening to [Cryptonomicon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon#Title), which I highly suggest for anybody remotly interested in technology and cryptology, and realized that I think Cryptography is freaking awesome. This sparked my interest in cryptography, in addition to some on campus event's on [the same subject](https://www.priv.ly/).

As far as I understand it, modern data encryption works like this: You've got Alice and Bob. Alice wants to tell Bob a secret so she gives Bob something called a Public Key. Bob can then encrypt messages to Alice by using the Public Key in certain algorithms so that Alice, and only Alice (and not Bob), can read them-- because she has the private key. This means that two people can communicate by sending messages that literally only one person can see the contents of. It's pretty crazy stuff! Up until a few days ago I was convinced this worked through a series of wires, black magic, and ritual sacrifices. I still do, but just... less so. 

Thanks to the [Simple English Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) I now understand the wonders of the [RSA Encryption Algorithm](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)); or at least more than I did previously. That isn't saying much, but I'm still very proud.

For me, it's not good enough to just read the Wiki page on RSA-- on no-- I had to try and implement at least a crude version of the algorithm for educational purposes; using small values and printing out everything (public keys, private keys, unencrypted message, encrypted message, decrypted message, etc). 

My first choice for an implementation language was [Lua](http://www.lua.org/). I figured if I intend to write a whole game in Lua using [Love2D](https://love2d.org/) I might as well get comfortable with it. 

So a few days ago I got cracking. I spent a few hours writing an implementation, felt pretty good about where things were going, and then I started getting errors, like all of my decrypted messages being 'nil'... 

I figured it was just some weird part of me not understanding the language enough so I switched over to C++, another language I might as well get comfortable in. Spent a few hours implementing the algorithm (the code wasn't that different, so it was faster the second time), and eventually hit the same problem. I kept getting 'inf' as an output... 

I soon realized I was dealing with big numbers... [very big numbers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7kEpw1tn50)... bigger than a 'long long int' numbers. 

I did some research and found some Lua and C++ libraries that could deal with Large Numbers, but after spending more time trying to deal with installing libraries (something I've never done before, and still technically haven't) than with the initial code I gave up. 

I have failed to implement the RSA Algorithm. That isn't to say that I haven't learned a lot, in fact I've learned more about encryption in this past week than I have in the past 18 years of my life. I may have failed to succeed in my task, but I still gained a heckofalota knowledge and this may very well be a project I revisit later, due to my personal level of interest in the subject. I might even take a crack at implementing it with Python since it's integers can apparently be arbitrarily large. 

All the code can be [viewed, cloned, and forked on my GitHub](https://github.com/ElijahCaine/RSA_attempts) as usual. Take a look. Maybe I was just doing something wrong with my implementation and you can make it work with a simple fix. Who knows.

Thanks for reading, -Elijah
