snippet:    I stop neglecting my blog for a little bit

---

I'm sorry blog. I didn't mean it. I really didn't.

No really! I didn't mean to neglect you for so long! I've just been so busy
with work and classes and well... if I'm being honest I've got a special gift
for you. It's [not quite ready yet](https://github.com/elijahcaine/pubrst) --
but I think you're really going to like it. A new coat of paint, a refurbished
engine... you'll love it.

What have I been doing? Oh well... I guess I've been up to a lot. Let me
think about this for a second...

Well first off I went to Los Angeles and gave a [talk on
Blender3D](http://osuosl.org/blog/scale-x13-0) at Scalex13. That was a very fun
conference to go to and I met a ton of excellent people and saw some even more
excellent talks.

Secondly I've started working on the awesome [Protein Geometry
Database](https://github.com/osuosl/pgd) project at the Open Source Lab. The
majority of my time initially was spent writing a cookbook to make development
and deployment of the project easier but I've slowly moved towards actual
development on the Django side of the project as well.

In addition to working on PGD with the OSL I've been helping teach the [DevOps
BootCamp](http://devopsbootcamp.osuosl.org/) curriculum all year. Helping
people learn awesome skills like Developing with Flask, Debugging, Linux
basics, configuration management, Docker, testing-- it's crazy how much stuff
we get to cover. It's not perfect but that's part of the challenge.

I also developed and deployed [HuRandom](http://hurandom.elijahcaine.me)
because I was curious to see how random people random number generators are.
The results were... well... let's just say my hypothesis was correct. If you
want to see the code behind the scenes for HuRandom [check it out on
GitHub](https://github.com/elijahcaine/hurandom)

Speaking of cool talks, I just got back from Write the Docs in Portland and
gave a lightning talk there that was very popular on [how to write an
email](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbug4C6ao_M&feature=youtu.be&t=23m1s).
The conference was awesome and the community there was very supportive. It felt
a little like a support group for people that have to deal with engineers all
day, but that's a feature not a bug I'm sure.

I've also had the honor of working with HashiCorp in the Hashi Scholars program
working with their [Atlas stack](http://github.com/hashicorp/atlas-examples/).
That has been very fun and working with a few other people remotely has been a
wonderful challenge.

Lastly I guess I started a [Book Club](http://elijahcaine.me/reading/). The
[code that runs the site](https://github.com/elijahcaine/book_club) is pretty
neat too, I basically threw together a static site generator using python,
jinja, and yaml. You can pip install it and everything! It's a nice backburner
hacking project that I can endlessly add onto whenever I feel the urge to hack
but don't actually want to be productive.

So there you have it blog. That's why I've been ignoring you. I've just been
so busy doing awesome things that I forgot to write about it. Don't worry
though, once I finish writing my static site generator for you it'll all be
okay. We can laugh and play and blerg about it all day long.
