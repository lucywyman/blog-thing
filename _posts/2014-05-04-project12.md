For my birthday my dad got me an Arduino Uno! So for this week's project I busted out my hacking supplies and made an Arduino based binary timer!

 This video is shows a sped up version of what the timer would look like in operation. It displays the number of minutes {in binary} on the left, and the number of hours {in binary} on the right. It resets after 24 hours.

I'm pretty happy with the Arduino so far. The programming language is basically C/C++, so there wasn't much of a learning curve there. I did have difficulty, and eventually gave up on, installing the Arduino Time library (hence the timer and not a clock). That said I enjoy using it and plan on doing some awesome home automation with this in the future.

As always the code is available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/ElijahCaine/Arduino_Timer). Check it out if you're interested.
