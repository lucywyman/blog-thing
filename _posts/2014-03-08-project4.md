I know it sounds silly but just give it a minute to sink in. Think about it: dogs don't let emotions get in the way of the task at hand... just like code; Programming languages have been molded by humans over many years to suit our needs best... just like dogs. In fact I may go as far as to say that this is the best metaphor for programming languages to date!

I could go into more detail as to why this metaphor is so perfect, but I think we'd both enjoy some examples a lot more:

[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) | [Golden Retriever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_retriever)

Easy to play with, great with kids, dynamically typed. A dependable companion through thick and thin.

[C](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) | [Great Dane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dane)

It's fame transcends itself. Nobody can deny that when you think of the subject at hand, this is the first thing you think of. Wiki-pages are populated with photos of this as the poster-child of the entire area of study. It may not be the best one, but it surely is the most well-known. A classic to be sure.

[Haskell](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)) | [Pomeranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomeranian_(dog))

Some people get it. I am not one of those people. But some people get it.

This devil spawn was created to place regret in the souls of those who were unfortunate enough to pick it up in the first place. Good luck -- not that it will help.

[Lua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)) | [Dachshund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dachshund)

It runs a little funny, acts a bit silly at times, and for some reason starts counting at 1...

[Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) | [Grey Wolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf)

The master OG. The badass from which all lesser descendants have spawned. The creator of all which we foolishly take for granted. You either quake with fear from knowing it's power or you are poorly uninformed.

As close to the previously mentioned OG without truly being the badass itself. Respectable none the less.

[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) | [Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat)

An easy mistake to make. Sadly you are a bit off. Perhaps you've only heard stories of dogs-- or seen blurry picture of code. Although you are going in the right direction, and it is very similar to the subject at hand: A cat is not a dog and HTML is not a programming language. Maybe next time bud. Maybe next time.

Full Disclosure: I have only personally used about half of the languages above; the extent of my knowledge of the remaining ones comes from my peers and online resources discussing the languages' pros and cons. Every coding language has it's positives and negatives, even Malbolge... probably.

For fear of sounding ignorant, I should clarify that I do respect every language for it's individual merits. HTML for example is a great platform for teaching those who don't code to understand how a computer thinks. Of course I have my own preferences for what languages I like to write in but that doesn't mean somebody else is wrong for using something different.
