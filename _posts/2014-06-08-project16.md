A few years ago I heard that [Robert Khoo used Countdown Timers in his office](http://ow.ly/i/56Jev). I thought this idea was really neat, and I've always been fascinated with how being aware of time can affect people and their actions, so I made the above. There's nothing like the number of days until the end of the term to light a fire under your ass. 

I wrote this in regular JavaScript with the help of some internet forum posts. I'm not very good at JavaScript so I figured I needed some practice and this was as good an opportunity as any. I was originally going to write it in [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) but didn't have root access on the server that hosts this website so I couldn't install [Gem](https://rubygems.org/) fair enough Sinatra itself. I could have found a workaround but I have finals to study for.

The Color Scheme comes from Wolf Thaddeus at COLOURlovers and is titled [The Lodge at Tofino](http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/3381069/The_Lodge_at_Tofino). I experimented with many themes and decided this one worked the best. I wanted it to look good but also be functional, I think I got pretty close to accomplishing that.

Thanks for reading! -Elijah
