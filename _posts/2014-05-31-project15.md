I made this:

The track is called "Test Map" and it is pretty short. It was a good introduction into building tracks in [Trals Fusion](http://www.redlynx.com/games/trials-fusion) and was actually just an excuse to play as much of this game as possible and still feel productive. I have to commend the Trials team over at [RedLynx](http://www.redlynx.com/) for making not only an amazing and addictive game but also an awesome moding package avaliable for PC and Consoles-- something we don't see very often. 

Anyway, I've got some Platimum Metals to get. Thank's for reading!
