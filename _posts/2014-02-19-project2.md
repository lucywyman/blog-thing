Project2 is a live action film titled 'The Mystery of the Cheetos Bag'. It was produced by [Sam Hall](http://500px.com/samallenhall) and myself about a month and a half ago; I only recently got around to editing a final product. Our challenge was to get enough footage to make something in a single day; we accomplished our goal and had a great time in the process.

And of course we made it with a budget of under $5, which was used for props... delicious... cheesy... props.
