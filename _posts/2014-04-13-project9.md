So I accidentally over-wrote the original project 9 and I forgot the push to github last week (never again), so I'm just going to summarize what happened:

Basically BeaverBarcamp is like open-mic TEDtalks and it's awesome and I did one on Blender and you can find the slides and files here. I'm going to do another talk like it next year and also hopefully do one on Coding for Blender because that's something I want to learn more about. Anyway, sorry I couldn't preserve this internet for you. Thank's for reading!"
