I think this is the first time I've worked on the same subject two weeks in a row... 

As I hinted at last week I took a shot at implementing RSA with Python and... it worked! As if by magic I threw together some code, entered a message, and BAM! Encrypted! 

There's not a whole lot more to add than the fact that I wrote a working RSA implementation. It's very simple and not secure (by design). You enter your message, p value, q value, public key value, and the program spits out your private key, encrypted message, and decrypted message. The extra flare I added were command line arguments (including --help and --version), which also required me to parse the command line arguments. I did not randomly generate any values, I left it all up to the user. Not because it would be difficult, just time consuming. 

Of course the code is available to view and edit. I added the py_rsa folder to the RSA_attempts repository I hosted my failed attempts in, so if you cloned the repo from last week's project just pull the update. Otherwise take a look at [it here](https://github.com/ElijahCaine/RSA_attempts).

Thank's for reading, -Elijah
