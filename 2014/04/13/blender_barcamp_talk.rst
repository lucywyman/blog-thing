Blender Barcamp Talk
====================

So I accidentally over-wrote the original project 9 and I forgot the push to
github last week (never again), so I'm just going to summarize what happened:

Basically BeaverBarcamp is like open-mic TEDtalks and it's awesome and I did
one on Blender and you can find the slides and files `here
<https://github.com/ElijahCaine/blenderBarcamp14Talk>`_. I'm going to do
another talk like it next year and also hopefully do one on Coding for Blender
because that's something I want to learn more about. Anyway, sorry I couldn't
preserve this internet for you. Thank's for reading!"
