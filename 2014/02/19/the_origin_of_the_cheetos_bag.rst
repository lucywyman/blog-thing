Project2 is a live action film titled 'The Mystery of the Cheetos Bag'. It was
produced by `Sam Hall <http://500px.com/samallenhall>`_ and myself about a month
and a half ago; I only recently got around to editing a final product. Our
challenge was to get enough footage to make something in a single day; we
accomplished our goal and had a great time in the process.
                                                                                   
And of course we made it with a budget of under $5, which was used for props...
delicious... cheesy... props.
