The Rules
=========

A few years ago `Johnathan Coulton <http://goo.gl/lMpIop>`_ got a lot of
publicity by doing a project called `'Thing A Week' <http://goo.gl/cBgkzD>`_ in
which he produced and published a new song every single week. Being a musician
this helped him develop as an artist as well has helped get his name out on the
internet. He wrote arguably the most popular song in gaming `'Still
Alive' <http://youtu.be/Y6ljFaKRTrI>`_ which geeks abound sing loud, proud, and
way out of tune to this day when they're in a good mood.

I can't hope to become as famous as J.C., but I also can't see any harm in
*doing my own 'Think A Week'*, if for no other reason than that it will give me
something constructive and awesome to do in my spare-time.

The purpose of this experiment will be to post something creative every single
week. In theory, doing my own 'thing a week' will provide an avenue to pursue
projects which I wouldn't normally. It should also drastically increase the
volume of my portfolio, something I always talk about doing but never get around
to.

Here's the rules:

1. Something I have created must be published every week before Sunday 23:59
*for* the next 52 weeks.
2. The thing does not need to be created in the week it is published, but should
be created recently.
3. The thing must be independent of any required work done for school or
extracurricular activities. It should be created for my 'Thing a Week' project.
4. The thing can be created in any medium: movie / still image / code / writing
/ etc, as long as it is creative
5. The punishment for missing a publishing date is to run a 5k, bike a 10k, and
row a 5k... In the same day. Evidence of these endevors will be published on the
'Thing a Week' site.
6. This is Week 1.

Update: It's now called Project52
