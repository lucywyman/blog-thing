=================================

TITLE:
------

Magic-Chicken-ocolypse

SUMMARY:
--------

Sorcerer Wizardston is stuck in a 640x480 arena with
randomly-appearing-death-filled-chickens! In a panic they remove their
conscience and send it flying up to the heavens where it lands inside your
computer! Now it's up to you to help kill off the chickens before they kill the
sorcerer. Don't forget! Three pecks and you're dead!

CONFLICT:
---------

Wizard must kill all chickens
Chickens harm Sorcerer. 3 hits and the player dies/ the game ends.
Chickens respawn at roughly 1.5 new chickens per 1 chicken killed.
When the player (Sorcerer) kills a chicken their score goes up by +1. {+2 for
Giga-Chickens}

OFFENSIVE ATTACKS:
------------------

* Magic Ball: A ball which instantly kills a chicken which it makes contact
  with. An infinite number are available to the player.
* Arena Wipe: Instantly kills all chickens in the arena. No points are rewarded
  for Arena Wipe kills. There is only a limited number available to the player.
  Chickens respawn to half if their previous quantity to give the player a
  breather.

ENEMIES

MISC:
-----

I would like to add the ability to gender-swap the playable character from
Witch (female) to Wizard (male) to Sorcerer (neither), but this will ultimately
be a cosmetic change and isn't at the top of my priority list.
