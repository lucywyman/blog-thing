Dogs are a lot like programming languages...
============================================

I know it sounds silly but just give it a minute to sink in. Think about it:
dogs don't let emotions get in the way of the task at hand... just like code;
Programming languages have been molded by humans over many years to suit our
needs best... just like dogs. In fact I may go as far as to say that this is
the best metaphor for programming languages to date!

I could go into more detail as to why this metaphor is so perfect, but I think
we'd both enjoy some examples a lot more:

`Python <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>`_ | `Golden Retriever <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_retriever>`_

Easy to play with, great with kids, dynamically typed. A dependable companion
through thick and thin.

`C <https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)>`_ | `Great Dane <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Dane>`_

It's fame transcends itself. Nobody can deny that when you think of the subject
at hand, this is the first thing you think of. Wiki-pages are populated with
photos of this as the poster-child of the entire area of study. It may not be
the best one, but it surely is the most well-known. A classic to be sure.

`Haskell <https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)>`_ | `Pomeranian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomeranian_(dog)>`_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some people get it. I am not one of those people. But some people get it.

`Malbolge <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge>`_ | `Chihuahua <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chihuahua_(dog)>`_
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This devil spawn was created to place regret in the souls of those who were
unfortunate enough to pick it up in the first place. Good luck -- not that it
will help.

`Lua <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)>`_ | `Dachshund <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dachshund>`_

It runs a little funny, acts a bit silly at times, and for some reason starts
counting at 1...

`Mathematics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics>`_ | `Grey Wolf <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf>`_
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The master OG. The badass from which all lesser descendants have spawned. The
creator of all which we foolishly take for granted. You either quake with fear
from knowing it's power or you are poorly uninformed.

`Assembly <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language>`_ | `Chechoslovakian Wolfdog <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakian_Wolfdog>`_

As close to the previously mentioned OG without truly being the badass itself.
Respectable none the less.

`HTML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML>`_ | `Cat <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat>`_

An easy mistake to make. Sadly you are a bit off. Perhaps you've only heard
stories of dogs-- or seen blurry picture of code. Although you are going in the
right direction, and it is very similar to the subject at hand: A cat is not a
dog and HTML is not a programming language. Maybe next time bud. Maybe next
time.

Full Disclosure: I have only personally used about half of the languages above;
the extent of my knowledge of the remaining ones comes from my peers and online
resources discussing the languages' pros and cons. Every coding language has
it's positives and negatives, even Malbolge... probably.

For fear of sounding ignorant, I should clarify that I do respect every
language for it's individual merits. HTML for example is a great platform for
teaching those who don't code to understand how a computer thinks. Of course I
have my own preferences for what languages I like to write in but that doesn't
mean somebody else is wrong for using something different.
