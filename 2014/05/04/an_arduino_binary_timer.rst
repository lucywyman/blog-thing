An Arduino Binary Timer!
========================

For my birthday my dad got me an Arduino Uno! So for this week's project I
busted out my hacking supplies and made an Arduino based binary timer!

This video is shows a sped up version of what the timer would look like in
operation. It displays the number of minutes {in binary} on the left, and the
number of hours {in binary} on the right. It resets after 24 hours.
                                                                                   
I'm pretty happy with the Arduino so far. The programming language is basically
C/C++, so there wasn't much of a learning curve there. I did have difficulty,
and eventually gave up on, installing the Arduino Time library (hence the timer
and not a clock). That said I enjoy using it and plan on doing some awesome
home automation with this in the future. 
                                                                                   
As always the code is available on `my GitHub
<https://github.com/ElijahCaine/Arduino_Timer>`_. Check it out if you're
interested.
