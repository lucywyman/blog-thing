Trials Fusion Custom Track
==========================

I made this:

The track is called "Test Map" and it is pretty short. It was a good
introduction into building tracks in `Trals Fusion
<http://www.redlynx.com/games/trials-fusion>`_ and was actually just an excuse
to play as much of this game as possible and still feel productive. I have to
commend the Trials team over at `RedLynx <http://www.redlynx.com/>`_ for making
not only an amazing and addictive game but also an awesome moding package
avaliable for PC and Consoles-- something we don't see very often.

Anyway, I've got some Platimum Metals to get. Thank's for reading!
