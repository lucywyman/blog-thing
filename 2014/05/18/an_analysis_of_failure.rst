An analysis of Failure
======================

Last week I did not publish a project. My excuse is that I had too much to do
an not enough time. I paid my dues in accordance with Project52's rule #5. It
was physically exhausting and a huge pain in my butt, but it wasn't all
terrible.
                                                                                   
I hate letting an experience go to waste, so this week's project is an analysis
on the upsides and downsides of failure to produce a project on time.
                                                                                   
Part 1: Downsides                                                              
-----------------
                                                                                   
1. By failing to get a project done on time I force future me to produce two
   projects in one week at some point between now and early February 2015 (Week
   52). This is going to be a hassle. It was largely unavoidable, I had too much
   stuff to do and couldn't get it all done in time. That doesn't change the fact
   that my failure now is going to be future me's problem down the road.
2. This particular failure was also physically taxing. By following through
   with this set of rapid fire physical challenges I signed myself up for a world
   of pain for the next few days. My muscles were sore and I was mentally wiped.
3. This completely destroys my winning streak. I can no longer claim that for
   52 weeks, regardless of how difficult the rest of my life was able to produce
   something every week for an entire year. I've never been a perfect student but
   this opportunity to claim perfection was nice one and now it is gone.
                                                                                   
Part 2: Upsides                                                                
---------------
                                                                                   
1. I may failed to produce a project last week and that may have force future
   me to produce more than he wants to, but this is also be a lesson for future
   and present me to budget his time, develop a better schedule, and know himself
   better.
2. Exercise is awesome. It's also something I've been putting on the
   back-burner more than I want to recently. Doing this exercise regimen reminded
   me how great it feels to set a physical goal that seems impossible and follow
   through with it. I was wiped after that exercise routine but it also felt
   awesome to say "I'm going to do this crazy thing today" and 90 minutes later
   say "Whoa. I just did that crazy thing. Heck yeah!"
3. ZeFrank once said "Let me realize that my past failures that follow through
   are no indication of my future performance, they're just healthy little fires
   that are gonna' warm up my ass." This is how I choose to look at this failure.
   It's not a foreshadowing that my Project52 is falling apart but rather that I
   need an incentive to never let it happen again. It felt bad realizing that I
   couldn't claim perfection on this thing that is so important to me but now I'll
   hopefully never let it happen again. I'll settle for 99% perfection instead of
   giving up and getting 0% success. 
                                                                                   
Part 3: Conclusion                                                             
------------------
                                                                                   
Failure is inevitable. When one pushes themselves past their limit then they
are doomed to fail; this isn't bad. Failure means one has left their comfort
zone and is on the road to further self improvement.
                                                                                   
Sometimes failure results in a lack of something (not getting a job, not
winning a competition, etc.) while other times it results in negative
repercussions (a penalty for not completing taxes on time, a bad grade on a
test, etc.). Whenever we experience failure the one thing we can always gain
from the experience is a greater understanding of ourselves, our strengths, and
our weaknesses.
                                                                                   
I may not be happy with the fact that I didn't complete a project last week,
but I will carry with me that incentive to work even harder. I won't let this
failure stop me dead in my tracks.
                                                                                   
Thank you for reading. This week and the next 39 to come.                          
                                                                                   
To clarify, this is my project13. Next week there will be a different project.
At some point between now and the 52nd week I will publish two projects to make
up the difference.

*The punishment for missing a publishing date is to run a 5k, bike a 10k, and
row a 5k... In the same day. Evidence of these endeavors will be published on
the 'Thing a Week' site.*

**Here is evidence of my penance. A total of 20 kilometers 'traveled' over
three different forms of exercise.**
