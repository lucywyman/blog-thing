<p>*This piece is a reflection of my personal experience being a Freshman at <a href="http://oregonstate.edu/">Oregon State University</a>. The format of this piece is inspired by <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/05/29/among-the-sleep-review-horror-pc/">Rock, Paper, Shotgun’s ‘Wot I Think’ series</a>, which is essentially a series of game reviews which don&#39;t give the reader stars or ‘good’/‘bad’ conclusions but rather personal experiences and anecdotes, letting the reader conclude the merit of the game for themselves. This is no guarantee that my review is as well constructed as an R.P.S. review.</p>

<p>This is also not a review of Oregon State University but rather the parts of my freshman year which I feel are universally applicable to every Universities’ programs. Anything that sounds like a review of OSU is purely accidental. Woops!*</p>

<p>College has become a necessity. Despite what your grandparent’s might say about how “It’s all optional and you really don’t need to bother getting a degree to make great money and have a life-long career” a college degree is a modern necessity for every competitive job market. One might be able to get work without a degree but when it comes time to get a raise, even if you work harder and get more done, some other guy with the same title and a degree is probably getting the pay bump while you don’t. At least that’s what I’m told; I’ve never been 40 years old in the job market asking for a raise without a college degree.</p>

<p>College is an interesting idea, at least based on the stories I’ve been told. It boils down to being a buffer between High School and the ‘Real World’. In theory you learn about yourself, get job experience, and get all that crazy manic behaviour out of your system before embarking on the rest of your life. College is where you’re allowed to mature and incubate in an academically stimulating environment and to hopefully find out what you are passionate about so you can pay tens of thousands of dollars to get a degree in it. There’s a lot of people that benefit from that buffer and most people do get a lot out of college... like what they want to do with the rest of their lives... and how many shots it takes before they start forgetting things.</p>

<p>Freshman year specifically is an interesting experience because one gets to see how individuals deal with a massive spike in freedom and independence. Living in the dorms you can tell immediately how many people had never had any real freedom before Dorm Move-In Day, and quite frankly most were not mentally prepared for the system shock that resulted. Week Three is about the time everybody goes out and parties for the first time and Saturday of Week Three you can see the misery in their eyes which says something between “I regret everything” and “Where is the bathroom again?” These people, the ones who can’t moderate themselves to save their lives, are the reason I’m okay with OSU’s requirement to live on campus for the first year. It’s expensive as hell but I honestly believe these people wouldn’t make it their first year if there weren’t dining halls everywhere, laundry in the basement, and class wasn’t a three minute walk away.</p>

<p>When it comes to classes I almost feel silly talking about them as actual classes or challenges in any way. I of course learned a lot in a few of my courses, but I’ve gotten conditioned to be a little embarrassed to talk about the Freshman class-load to anybody who’s not a freshman because of how easy it all is. The classes aren’t exactly a breeze, but I also can’t say they’re anything more than tedious at their most challenging. I enjoyed parts of the curriculum, but everything felt like a requirement, which anybody who has been assigned reading for school knows: if it’s a requirement, it sucks. I liked some classes and hated others, but overall they just got in the way of all the other stuff I wanted to do. They didn’t usually engage me enough make me think what I was doing was worth anything beyond the grade I would get at the end. This might be different at an Ivy League University or a world class school for my specific major, but I’m comfortable saying this is universal because most people don’t go to an Ivy Leagues and most people I talk to don’t focus on the classes when talking about their ‘College Experience’.</p>

<p>As far as paid positions are concerned, there’s definitely a dismissive attitude toward freshman at job fairs and other job-searching venues. This makes sense since most freshman don’t have much more than a high-school education and are still ‘kids’; plus they’re not under the same time pressure as a junior or senior level student to get internships and work experience before they graduate. This of course didn’t stop me and my peers from getting summer jobs and internships, but these were almost all gotten through our own means and not job fairs.</p>

<p>Free-time was interesting because I had quite a bit of it. There were of course the first few weeks in which I had to learn to take care of myself as well as get my classwork done; I’ll admit there were a few missed meals that first quarter. By the end of the first term I was almost completely self-sufficient and had a handle on all my classes. I was able to join a club full of excited and passionate tech-enthused individuals called the <a href="http://lug.osuosl.org/">Linux User’s Group</a> and I’m glad I did. The passion found at LUG is something I’ve always gravitated towards, and I’m excited I was able to find such an awesome group of people so early on in my College Career. I learned a lot being immersed in that environment and through those connections got a job at the <a href="http://osuosl.org/">Open Source Lab</a> on campus as a student developer, a position I’m very excited for and will probably write about further after I’ve gotten my legs.</p>

<p>I can’t say I strictly enjoyed my freshman year of college but I do expect things to get better as the years go on. When one looks on paper I seem to be on track to having my life together (e.g., moderate to high grades, getting a job, befriending interesting people) but something about the whole experience causes me to feel... crummy(e.g., feeling physically miserable, constant mental fatigue and physical exhaustion, a lack of personal connection with many of my peers). This underlying current of crummy (I honestly can’t think of a better word for it right now, sorry) has dampened the rest of my success making it difficult to celebrate what I have done well because there is always this nagging feeling in the back of my head that what I am doing is wrong and even though I should be happy that feeling isn’t there. The hardest part of this nagging feeling of ‘crummy’ is that I don’t know what I could do that would feel ‘better’ so I keep chugging along. This of course is a discussion for another day after I’ve meditated on it for a while and gotten to know myself a lot better. </p>
