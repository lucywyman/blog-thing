    <p>A few years ago <a href="http://goo.gl/lMpIop">Johnathan Coulton</a> got a lot of publicity by doing a project called <a href="http://goo.gl/cBgkzD">&quot;Thing A Week&quot;</a> in which he produced and published a new song every single week. Being a musician this helped him develop as an artist as well has helped get his name out on the internet. He wrote arguably the most popular song in gaming <a href="http://youtu.be/Y6ljFaKRTrI">&#39;Still Alive&#39;</a> which geeks abound sing loud, proud, and way out of tune to this day when they&#39;re in a good mood.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t hope to become as famous as J.C., but I also can&#39;t see any harm in <em>doing my own &#39;Think A Week&#39;</em>, if for no other reason than that it will give me something constructive and awesome to do in my spare-time.</p>

<p>The purpose of this experiment will be to post something creative every single week. In theory, doing my own &#39;thing a week&#39; will provide an avenue to pursue projects which I wouldn&#39;t normally. It should also drastically increase the volume of my portfolio, something I always talk about doing but never get around to. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the rules:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Something I have created must be published every week before Sunday 23:59 <em>for</em> the next 52 weeks.</p></li>
<li><p>The thing does not need to be created in the week it is published, but should be created recently.</p></li>
<li><p>The thing must be independent of any required work done for school or extracurricular activities. It should be created for my &#39;Thing a Week&#39; project. </p></li>
<li><p>The thing can be created in any medium: movie / still image / code / writing / etc, as long as it is creative</p></li>
<li><p>The punishment for missing a publishing date is to run a 5k, bike a 10k, and row a 5k... In the same day. Evidence of these endevors will be published on the &#39;Thing a Week&#39; site.</p></li>
<li><p>This is Week 1.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Update: It&#39;s now called Project52</p>
