A New Coat of Paint `2015-09-09`
--------------------------------

That's right, I finally re-did my blog. It's amazing what you can do when you
completely ignore your incredibly high personal bar and just prioritize getting
the job done.

It's not pretty, but dangit this thing will get updated weekly.

ps:

I'll work on migrating old content over soon. First thing's first though -- sleep.
