An Update on the Update `2015-09-10`
------------------------------------

I did a lot of work on the blogy-thingy-engine-stuff... I'm still not sure what
to call this. It's not a very formal project to start with so I might just
formally not formalize the name. Take that SEO, find me now why don't you!

Anyway.

I worked on the 'engine' a bit, worked on the theme a bit, added archive
functionality so the side-bar doesn't eventually get *way too big*. Not that I
wouldn't find that comical, but... sometimes it's nice to have a sidebar that's
smaller than the posts you write.

If you don't stalk my Github profile then you probably don't know that `this
blog is on Github`_ and you can look at all of the terribly written source code
for the 'engine', the content, and the theme. I haven't gotten around to
writing things like a README... or documentation... or comments... or a license
-- but they're coming soon I promise!

Speaking (tangentially) of README's, I'm gonna go read REAMDE before I fall
asleep.
